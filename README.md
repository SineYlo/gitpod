Site topic: `Automating work with GIT`  
Site language: `EN`

### 📚 What was implemented by me:

- On this project, a rather interesting swiper `Glider.js` was used, as well as the `Scroll Reveal` plugin, which creates cool animations of the appearance of content

### 🐍 My comments on this work:

🔸 Well, what can I say, this is probably the first site on which I decided to apply animation of the appearance of content  
🔸 In principle, the layout itself is quite interesting, but I was amused by the moment that the designer did almost every word in a separate block, which simply made it difficult to copy the text  
🔸 An interesting experience with `Glider.js`, in principle, an interesting replacement for `Swiper.js` if you need to quickly create a light and simple swiper (I don’t know if it’s a plugin problem, it sometimes breaks, but when you reload the page, everything is fine)
